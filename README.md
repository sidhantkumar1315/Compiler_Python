# Compiler_Python
Welcome to the Compiler_Python project! This repository contains a Python-based compiler that is divided into three main components: Scanner Analysis, Syntactic Analysis, and Semantic Analysis. Each component is designed to demonstrate key concepts in language processing and compiler design.

## Project Structure
scanner-analysis/: Contains the code and documentation for the lexical analysis phase, where input strings are tokenized using regular expressions.
syntactic-analysis/: Includes the parser implementation that checks the syntax of the code based on defined grammar rules.
semantic-analysis/: Features the semantic analyzer that ensures logical consistency and meaningfulness in code execution.

## Getting Started
To get started with the Compiler_Python project, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the Repository:**

```BASH

git clone https://github.com/sidhantkumar1315/Compiler_Python.git
cd Compiler_Python
```
2. **Explore Each Component:**

- Navigate to each subdirectory to find specific instructions and code for that part of the compiler.
- Each subdirectory contains its own README.md with detailed information on setup and usage.
  
3. **Run the Compiler:**
- Follow the instructions in each component's README to run and test the respective parts of the compiler.
